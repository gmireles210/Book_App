# Book_App

# Project Name

**Author**: Greg
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
I started working on this lab which utilizes the Google API for books which when used, will allow a user to query books based on either author or book title and then display the results.


## Getting Started
The steps would be to install all required dependencies, then set-up your files, then run local hosted server, then deploy a Heroku app.


## Architecture
In this lab, several languages were used such as ejs, js, superagent, node, nodemon, express, env, google books api, and html
